# Trie Data Structure in Python üóÇÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Trie Data Structure in Python** repository! In this project, we will explore how the **Trie** (also known as a **Prefix Tree**) works and how to implement it in Python. Tries are used in various applications such as **autocomplete systems**, **spell checkers**, and **IP routing**.

## üìö What is a Trie?

A **Trie** is a **tree-like** data structure that is used to store a dynamic set of strings, where the keys are usually strings. It is especially useful for solving problems related to **prefix matching**. The core idea behind a Trie is to store strings such that common prefixes are only stored once, which saves space.

In a Trie:
- Each node represents a character in a string.
- Each edge represents a part of the string, leading to the next character in the sequence.
- The root node is empty, and strings are inserted by adding nodes corresponding to each character in the string.
  
The primary use case for a Trie is **prefix-based searching**‚Äîfinding all strings that share a common prefix.

### Example Trie:

```text
          root
         /   \
        t     a
       / \     \
      r   e     b
     /         / \
    i         a   t
   / \       /     \
  e   n     s       r
 /         \
x           p
